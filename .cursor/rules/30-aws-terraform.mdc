Terraform rules:
- Terraform changes are isolated to infra/terraform only.
- No manual edits in AWS console are assumed.
- Every resource must have tags: project, environment, owner.
- Provide outputs for:
  - queue URLs (SQS)
  - bucket names (S3)
  - ECR repositories
  - cluster endpoints (EKS, later)

EDA principles:
- Ingestion events are immutable.
- Use DLQ for failed messages.
- Idempotency is required for ingestion writes.
