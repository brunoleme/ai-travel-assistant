You are contributing to a multi-service agentic RAG system.

Non-negotiables:
- Respect folder ownership boundaries in docs/OWNERSHIP.md.
- All inter-service payloads must conform to /contracts JSON Schemas.
- No breaking contract changes without bumping x_contract_version and updating all consumers.

Tech:
- Python + uv as package manager (uv sync / uv run)
- FastAPI + WebSockets for agent runtime
- MCP servers for travel knowledge and product selection
- Weaviate for vector storage
- AWS + Terraform for infra

If you need Weaviate schema or retrieval/ingestion reference, read docs/experiments/* first. Do not copy notebook code verbatim.
