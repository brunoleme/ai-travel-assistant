Workflow rules (must follow):
1) TDD: write or update tests first, then implement code to make them pass.
2) Keep changes small and scoped to your owned folder.
3) Use Make targets as proof of completion:
   - make test-<service>
   - make lint
4) No direct network calls in unit tests.
   - Use mocks/fakes and contract fixtures.
5) All new functions must have docstrings and type hints.
